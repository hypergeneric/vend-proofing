---------------------
* (a) ITDR herby grants you and your Authorized Users a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Mobile Apps solely for the Company's internal business purposes, subject to the terms of this Agreement and any terms required to download the Mobile Apps.  **We make no claim that the Mobile Apps are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United States. You must comply with local laws if you choose to access the Mobile Apps from a location outside the U.S.**
* (b) We reserve the right to amend or withdraw the Mobile Apps, or charge for the Mobile Apps.  ITDR does not provide any support or maintenance for the Mobile Apps.
* (c) You and your Authorized Users must provide the equipment and wireless connections necessary to access the Mobile Apps, at your own expense. You acknowledge that the terms of agreement with your Company's and each of your Authorized Users' respective mobile network providers ("***Mobile Provider***") will continue to apply when using the Mobile Apps. As a result, the Company and its Authorized Users may be charged by the Mobile Providers for access to network connection services for the duration of the connection while accessing the Mobile Apps, for data downloading, email, text messages, and for roaming and other Mobile Provider or third party charges as may arise. **YOU ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY SUCH CHARGES**.
* (d) When your Authorized Users access Mobile Apps on their Mobile Devices, we may obtain information from their Mobile Providers about the type of Mobile Devices they are using. We may use this information to notify them on features and products that be available to them on their Mobile Devices via the Mobile Apps.  Certain features of the Mobile Apps may require our collection of the phone number of Authorized Users' Mobile Devices. We may associate that phone number to the mobile device identification information, however we will not use that number for telemarketing.  In addition, some Mobile Providers in the U.S. are required to operate a system that will pinpoint the physical location of Mobile Devices that use their service.  Depending on the Mobile Provider, we may automatically receive this information. In the future, if we begin to offer services that use pinpointing technology, we will ensure that we have each Authorized User's consent (an opt-in) before using the information. We may use and store this information to provide enhanced location-based services as well as to serve location-targeted advertising.
* (e) You will NOT, nor allow your Authorized Users or any third parties on your behalf to:
     * (i) make and distribute copies of the Mobile Apps;
     * (iii) install, use or permit the Mobile Apps to exist on more than one Mobile Device at a time, or on any other Mobile Device or computer, other than by means of separate downloads of the Mobile Apps by your Authorized Users, each of which is subject to a separate license; 
     * (iv) distribute or link the Mobile Apps to multiple Mobile Devices or other services; or 
     * (v) make the Mobile Apps available over a network or other environment permitting access or use by multiple Mobile Devices or users at the same time.
* (f) You acknowledge the Mobile Apps are provided over the internet and mobile networks and so the quality and availability of the Mobile Apps may be affected by factors outside our control.  **We do not guarantee that the Mobile Apps will be compatible or interoperable with your Authorized Users' Mobile Providers' service plans, or with any particular Mobile Devices or other piece of hardware, software, equipment or device installed on or used in connection with your Authorized Users' Mobile Devices.  We are not responsible for unavailability of the Mobile Apps, or any difficulty or inability to download or access content, compatibility or interoperability issues, or any communication system failure which may result in the Mobile Apps being unavailable**. 
* (g) We may offer functionality in the Mobile Apps in which your Authorized Users may store their log-in credentials on their Mobile Devices, so that they can be automatically logged in each time they access the Mobile Apps. Please note that if someone else obtains access to an Authorized User's Mobile Device (e.g., through theft), the automatic log-in feature will enable that person to have access to your Authorized User's Mobile Apps account. Therefore, in the event an Authorized User's Mobile Device is lost or stolen, it is their responsibility to contact their wireless carrier immediately to prevent the unauthorized use of the Mobile Apps. **YOU ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ITDR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM SUCH UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO THE MOBILE APPS**.

16. <u>MEMBERSHIP PRICING</u>
-------------------------------
Monthly & Annual Membership fees: The currently monthly membership fee ranges from $29-$59/mo (billed once per month). The annual membership plan ranges from $57- $147/quarterly (billed quarterly). This fee provides you with storage space and monthly bandwidth that range from 250MB to 10GB. This fee is collected after any free trial period. 

Additional Bandwidth and Storage usage fees: Your monthly membership comes with a specific amount of storage and bandwidth. If you need or use additional storage, the account will automatically increase your amount in increments of 1GB. If your account were to use more then the allotted amount, your account will be charged $5 per GB per month for the additional bandwidth and $5 per GB per month for additional storage space. These fees will be charged to your account on a monthly basis – even if you chose a 6 month or 12 month billing cycle. 

Billing Cycle: Your first billing date will be at the point of membership creation or the day following any free trial period. Future billing dates will occur on the same day of the next appropriate month/quarter/year based on the chosen billing cycle (or closest to the same day in the case of the last day of the month). 

Failure to pay: If you fail to pay your membership or usage fees, you are subject to cancellation or late fees starting at $10 per month. Upon cancellation, your installations and data will be deleted permanently. We reserve the right to suspend or cancel your account at anytime. 

Domain names: Intothedarkroom will provide an account domain name that can be used to install products (example: something.intothedarkroom.com). In addition, each plan allows you a different amount of free domain names that range from 0-5 that will be included in your membership fee. Each additional domain name that is added to your account will cost an additional $10/mo per domain. 

Trial period: If you are provided a trial period, you will not be billed until the trial period has ended. To avoid any charges, you must cancel your account before the trial period ends. 

Cancellation: Cancellation must take place before your next billing cycle. We will not refund or prorate any prepaid amounts. You may receive a final bill for any additional usage charges from the prior month. You are responsible for all fees associated with the account. 

Hibernation: Hibernating your account will cost $10/mo plus $1.50 per GB of space that your account is using. By hibernating your account, you are extending any prepaid cycle. Your prepaid billing cycle will resume once you take your account out of hibernation. 

Free account: If you have received a free account, it comes with limited space, bandwidth and options. It is to be used a means of testing the services and can be terminated by Intothedarkroom at any time for any reason. Some promotional codes can only be activated from a free account.
